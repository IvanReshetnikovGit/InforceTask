This web application allows users to shorten long URLs into simpler, shareable links. When a user submits a URL, the system checks if it has already been shortened for that user. If not, it creates a unique short code using random characters and saves it along with the original URL. The short link looks like a regular web address with the short code at the end. When someone clicks the shortened link, the system finds the original URL and redirects the user there. Each shortened link is tied to the user who created it, and only that user or an admin can delete it. Admins also have access to edit this description.
